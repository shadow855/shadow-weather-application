## Brief description of the approach and technologies used.

1. I used React.js for making the frontend of the website and OpenWeatherMap wesbite for getting API_KEY for fetching the weather data.
2. I first designed the functions and methods for fetching the weather data with the help of API, then I created the design to display that data.
3. I used Chakra Toast to handle the errors and to show notifications.
4. I used stackoverflow, to resolve some of the errors I faced while making the website.
5. I used VS Code for creating the website.
